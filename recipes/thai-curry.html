                    <p>Kaeng khiao waan gai, or green curry with chicken, is one of the most well-known and popular Thai
                        curries in
                        the world. A rich coconut milk-based curry, part of its crowd-pleasing nature is its balance:
                        it’s
                        spicy,
                        but not too spicy; it’s sweet, but not too sweet; and the richness of the coconut milk pairs
                        well
                        with the
                        relative leanness of chicken meat. The curry takes its name from the green chiles used to make
                        prik
                        gaeng
                        khiao waan, the curry paste that forms its base, which also contains fresh aromatics, like
                        lemongrass,
                        galangal, garlic, and shallots, along with dried spices and shrimp paste. (The curry paste is
                        fundamentally
                        identical to the red curry paste, prik gaeng phet, used to make red curry, or gaeng phet, aside
                        from
                        the
                        fact that it uses green chiles instead of dried red chiles.)


                        Like many Thai dishes, there’s a lot of speculation about its origins. Hanuman Aspler, a scholar
                        of
                        Thai
                        food and one of my mentors, has noted that green curry is a relatively new addition to Thai
                        cuisine,
                        one
                        that likely originated in the kitchens of the Thai aristocracy sometime during the 1920s. In his
                        examination
                        of historic Thai cookbooks, Aspler found few if any mentions of green curry, just red curry. And
                        although
                        there’s no definite answer as to why green chiles came to be used in place of red chiles to make
                        green curry
                        paste, there is speculation that the substitution came about due to the influence of
                        Indian-style
                        curries.

                    <ol>
                        <li>In a small bowl, whisk together 1/2 cup (120ml) coconut milk and 1/2 cup (120ml) water; set
                            thinned
                            coconut milk mixture aside. Remove and discard the mid-rib from the makrut lime leaves; set
                            8 of
                            the
                            leaves aside. Stack remaining 2 makrut lime leaves, fold in half widthwise, then slice into
                            hair-thin
                            strips; set aside separately. </li>
                        <li>In a 3-quart saucepan, combine coconut oil with 1/2 cup (120ml) coconut milk and bring to a
                            simmer over
                            medium heat. Cook, stirring often with a rubber spatula, until thickened slightly, about 1
                            minute. </li>
                        <li>Add curry paste, stir vigorously to combine, and use a rubber spatula to scrape sides of the
                            saucepan to
                            fully incorporate paste. Raise heat to medium-high and cook, stirring and scraping
                            constantly
                            until
                            paste mixture begins to spit (which indicates that water content has been cooked off, and
                            mixture has
                            begun to fry in coconut oil), about 1 minute. Lower heat back to medium, and continue to
                            cook
                            while
                            gradually adding remaining 1/2 cup (120ml) coconut milk in 2-tablespoon (30ml) increments,
                            until
                            paste
                            darkens slightly and the fat begins to separate from curry paste, 5 to 6 minutes.</li>
                        <li>Add fish sauce and palm sugar, and stir until palm sugar is fully dissolved, about 30
                            seconds.
                            Lightly
                            season chicken on all sides with salt, add to saucepan with reserved whole makrut lime
                            leaves,
                            and stir
                            to evenly coat with curry paste mixture. Add reserved thinned coconut milk mixture and bring
                            to
                            a
                            simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, until chicken is cooked through and tender and liquid
                            has
                            thickened
                            slightly, about 10 minutes.</li>
                        <li>Add eggplants, and continue to cook, adjusting heat as needed to maintain a simmer, until
                            eggplants are
                            just cooked through but still have some bite to them, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat, add
                            sweet
                            basil, and stir until wilted and incorporated. </li>
                        <li>Transfer curry to a large serving bowl or divide between individual bowls, and garnish with
                            reserved
                            thinly-sliced makrut lime leaves. Serve with cooked jasmine rice. </li>
