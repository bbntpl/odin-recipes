        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Below is what I do at home when I want it "restaurant style" (e.g., overwhelmingly creamy and flavorful). I
            won't claim this is terribly "authentic" as far as Indian cuisine goes, but it is really good. It's fairly
            complex--a ton of restaurants would just use a base curry sauce and some pre-powdered or jarred curry flavor
            mix, but that's pretty hard to replicate without knowing their exact combination. Instead, below, I try to
            rely on tons of fat, salt, sweetness, and spices to replicate the rich, powerful flavor of restaurant
            cuisine.</p>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Stir together the first 9 ingredients (Yogurt to Lime Juice), beating until smooth and a deep red color, then mix in the chicken pieces. Marinate, stirring occasionally, for 4-8 hours.</li>
            <li>When you're ready to cook the chicken, ideally you'll want to use a grill over fairly high flame, but an easy at-home alternative is to soak bamboo skewers in water for an hour, then thread the chicken pieces onto them. Lay the skewers across a deep baking dish or pan (so that the chicken pieces are "suspended" in mid-air above it), then broil under high heat for about 5 minutes, turning once halfway through, or until the chicken is cooked through and beginning to blacken in small spaces. Reserve.</li>
            <li>In a large stockpot or dutch oven, heat 2 tbsp of the butter over medium heat until it's melted and done sizzling. Add in the diced onions and cook, stirring, for about 8-10 minutes, until they are well-softened and turning golden. Mix in the ginger-garlic paste and cook, stirring, for another 2-3 minutes to cook out the raw flavors in the paste. Then, add in the green chilies and cook another minute.</li>
            <li>At this time, pour in your cashew-nut paste and cook for another minute. Add in the dried spices and seasonings (salt, chili powder, turmeric, cumin, coriander, and paprika) and cook, stirring well, for about 30-60 seconds to "wake up" the spices. Add in your chopped tomatoes and cook for another 10 minutes or so, stirring occasionally (and adding water if you need to to keep it from sticking/burning) until the tomatoes are darkened and well-pulverized.</li>
            <li>Add in the remaining water and--if you like a very smooth curry--use an immersion blender to completely puree the masala base you have in your pot now. If you do so, watch your heat and keep a lid handy--the liquefied tomatoes tend to pop and bubble.</li>
            <li>Add in the chicken pieces, then the cream, honey, qasuri methi (rub it between your palms to powder it well), garam masala, and cilantro leaves, as well as the remaining 4 tbsp of butter.</li>
            <li>Taste the curry, checking to make sure it has the appropriate levels of salty, sweet, and tangy. You can add a little lime juice if it's too salty, a little more honey if it's too tangy, and a little salt if it's too sweet.</li>
            <li>Serve over steamed basmati rice with buttered naan.</li>
